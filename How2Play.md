	How to run the game?

	When the game window pops up, we can either start a new server by clicking the Start Server button or join to an already existing server by clicking the Join Button. If you click on the Start Server button, a window pops up and asks the number of players for that game session. When the player connects to his/ her local host, the player creates a client. If you click on the Join Server button instead, the local address that you want to join into is asked. So, if the game is played between different computers, their IP addresses should be known. In the case of playing the game in one computer, the IP address that you need to join is displayed after the client is created by the founder player (the player who starts the game first). Regardless of whether you create a new game or join to an already established game, in the server screen two options are displayed: Start Game and Quit Server. 
	The game starts after the Start Game button is clicked. The board is displayed on the left side of the screen. In the middle part, we have the Button Panel. Roll Button is used to roll dice and move the player. Buy Property button is used to buy an unowned property. The button becomes invisible if the square that the player is on is not a property square or if the property square is already owned. Draw Card button is below the Buy Property button, it is used to draw an action card, such as a Community Chest Card or a Chance Card. Lastly, Improve Property button is used to upgrade a property. Above the button panel, we have Dice Panel. The values that are obtained from the roll dice button are displayed in the Dice Panel.
	Player panel is on the right side of the Button Panel. The name of the players are displayed as buttons on a scrollable panel. When the names of the players are clicked, several information about them are displayed such as the Player name, Money, Owned properties and Owned utilities. 
	  Lastly, on the bottom left part of the game window screen, we have the Message Box Panel. Messages can be written into the text field and by using the Submit button, we messages be sent. The messages are displayed on the screen below the Player Panel. When new messages are added, they are first fitted into the message box screen and after a certain number of messages, we messages are displayed as a scrollable panel.
	We also have an additional panel (Menu Window) on the top part of the screen. In that panel, there are Send Message, Menu, Game and Quit buttons. This part is currently used by the developer and its main purpose is to test the game more easily. When the Send Message button is clicked, if the server is working, “hello” message is displayed on the console. Menu and Game buttons allows the developer to quickly switch through the game and the server menu. Finally, Quit button is used to close the game window.
